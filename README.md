# **Bank Loan Status Prediction**

This project predicts the acceptance or rejection of bank loan applications based on several features such as Gender, Married, co-applicant income, Applicant Income, and others. The prediction is made using machine learning algorithms, specifically Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM), implemented using PySpark MLlib.

## **Problem Statement**
Bank loan applications are often rejected or accepted based on certain characteristics of the applicants. The objective of this project is to predict whether a loan application will be accepted or rejected based on features such as Gender, Marital Status, Coapplicant Income, and Applicant Income. In this project, we compare the performance of two machine learning models: Decision Tree and SVM, to determine which model performs better for this problem.

## Technologies Used
PySpark MLlib: For implementing machine learning models.

Python: For data processing and implementation of algorithms.

Jupyter Notebooks/IDE: For running and testing the project code.

## Key Features

Decision Tree Classifier: The decision tree model is used to classify the loan status based on various input features.

SVM (Support Vector Machine): Another classification algorithm to compare with the Decision Tree in terms of performance.

Data Processing: Using PySpark for handling large datasets and performing feature engineering.

Evaluation: Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
